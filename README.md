# Python Classes

The repository contains solutions to exercises from Python classes conducted as part of the Data Science program at the Faculty of Computer Science, Electronics and Telecommunications at AGH University of Science and Technology in semester 0 of 2022.

## Repository structure

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a solution for homework from particular classes. 
List of mini-projects

- Aho-Corasick automaton implementation - implementation of the Aho-Corasick algorithm, used for pattern matching in text strings.
- Graph class implementation - implementation of the Graph class, allowing for adding and removing vertices and edges, as well as performing breadth-first search and depth-first search algorithms on the graph.
- Word-counting - This program provides a function that counts occurrences of all words in a text file. It also allows for displaying n most frequently occurring words, including ties (i.e., if words at positions n+1 and n+2 occur the same number of times as the one at position n, they should also be displayed). The program was tested on the attached file potop.txt.
- Library management system - implementation of a library management system, allowing for logging in as a reader or a librarian. Readers can borrow and reserve books, extend the borrowing time, and browse the catalog. Librarians can accept book returns, add new books, remove books from the system, add readers, and browse the catalog. The system stores its data on disk and changes made during one run of the program should be visible in the next.
- kNN classification algorithm implementation - implementation of the kNN (k-nearest neighbors) algorithm for binary classification. The algorithm provides the train and predict methods. The train method builds a training set (accepting at least vectors and correct answers). The predict method accepts a vector (optionally, more vectors at once) and returns the classifier's response. The user can choose one of four distance functions: Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev, and Cosine. The algorithm was compared using at least 3 different values of k, and the results were presented on given datasets.
- pandas exercises

To run the programs from the classes, Python environments with necessary packages installed is required.
